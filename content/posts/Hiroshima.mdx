# How to Build a Simple Web Application with Next.js

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to create a basic web application using **Next.js**, a powerful framework for building server-side rendered React applications.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). npm comes bundled with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically.

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Step 2: Create a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use create-next-app, which sets up a Next.js project with everything you need.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

## Step 3:  Run the Development Server

Navigate into your project directory and start the development server by running:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser, and you should see the Next.js welcome page.

## Step 4: Modify the Pages

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. The `pages` directory contains different pages of your app.

You can modify `pages/index.js` to customize the home page. For example:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My First Next.js App</h1>
      <p>This is a simple web application created with Next.js.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Save the file and refresh your browser to see the updated page.
